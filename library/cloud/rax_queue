module: rax_queue
short_description: create / delete a queue in Rackspace Public Cloud
description:
     - creates / deletes a Rackspace Public Cloud queue.
version_added: "1.5"
options:
  api_key:
    description:
      - Rackspace API key (overrides C(credentials))
  credentials:
    description:
      - File to find the Rackspace credentials in (ignored if C(api_key) and
        C(username) are provided)
    default: null
    aliases: ['creds_file']
  name:
    description:
      - Name to give the queue
    default: null
  region:
    description:
      - Region to create the load balancer in
    default: DFW
  state:
    description:
      - Indicate desired state of the resource
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
    default: present
  username:
    description:
      - Rackspace username (overrides C(credentials))
requirements: [ "pyrax" ]
author: Christopher H. Laco, Matt Martz
notes:
  - The following environment variables can be used, C(RAX_USERNAME),
    C(RAX_API_KEY), C(RAX_CREDS_FILE), C(RAX_CREDENTIALS), C(RAX_REGION).
  - C(RAX_CREDENTIALS) and C(RAX_CREDS_FILE) points to a credentials file
    appropriate for pyrax. See U(https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#authenticating)
  - C(RAX_USERNAME) and C(RAX_API_KEY) obviate the use of a credentials file
  - C(RAX_REGION) defines a Rackspace Public Cloud region (DFW, ORD, LON, ...)
